### Scala learning

##### Scala is object-oriented 
- every value is an object
- types and behaviours of objects are described by classes and traits 
- classes can be extended by sublclassing and by using a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance

##### Scala is functional 
- every function is a value 
- it provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions
- it supports higher-order functions
- it allows functions to be nested
- it supports currying
- Scala’s case classes and its built-in support for pattern matching provide the functionality of algebraic types
- singleton objects provide a convenient way to group functions that aren't members of the class

##### Scala is statically typed 
- Scala’s expressive type system enforces, at compile-time, that abstractions are used in a safe and coherent manner.
- the type system supports:
    - generic classes
    - variance annotations 
    - upper and lower type bounds
    - inner classes and abstract type members as object members
    - compound types
    - explicitly typed self references
    - implicit parameters and conversions
    - polymorphic methods
    - type inference
    
#### Scala is extensible
In practice, the development of domain-specific applications often requires domain-specific language extensions. Scala provides a unique combination of language mechanisms that make it straightforward to add new language constructs in the form of libraries.
(Implicit classes, String interpolation).

##### Scala interoperates
